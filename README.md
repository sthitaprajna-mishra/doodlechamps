## My process

### Built with

- React
- Vite
- Canva
- TailwindCSS
- Material UI
- SocketIO
- Node
- Express

### Insights

- I initially considered incorporating Material UI for a majority of the app's components. However, during the development process, I opted to utilize TailwindCSS for the core design, reserving Material UI exclusively for the purpose of integrating icons. This decision provided me with a greater degree of creative liberty, enabling me to craft and style components that align more closely with my individual preferences and the overarching design concept of the website.

- In this project, while the primary focus was on the frontend, I delved into the world of backend development to handle real-time messages using Socket.io. Despite the project's frontend-centric nature, I dedicated a significant amount of time to research and implement the backend logic.

- I opted to utilize Canva for the creation of the background images, a step that may not have been technically imperative but was driven by my desire to align the aesthetics with the vivid vision I had in mind. The use of Canva allowed me to meticulously craft the visual appeal of the platform, ensuring that it harmoniously matched the artistic concept I envisioned.

### Scope for Improvement

- Add an ability to incorporate emoticons and GIFs in conversations. This will infuse life and expressiveness into every exchange, making interactions more engaging and entertaining.

- At present, this app doesn't utilize a traditional database to store conversations. This aligns with the core concept of the application, which prioritizes short and spontaneous interactions over comprehensive, long-term chat histories. However, to effectively manage scalability and accommodate increasing demand, it is possible to explore some real-time data storage solutions that can enhance the app's performance while still preserving its unique focus on quick and dynamic conversations.
